  But you know what the funniest thing
  about Europe is?

  What?

  It's the little differences. A lotta
  the same shit we got here, they got
  there, but there they're a little
  different.

  Examples?

  Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer
  in a movie theatre. And I don't mean
  in a paper cup either. They give you
  a glass of beer, like in a bar. In
  Paris, you can buy beer at
  MacDonald's. Also, you know what
  they call a Quarter Pounder with
  Cheese in Paris?

  They don't call it a Quarter Pounder
  with Cheese?

  No, they got the metric system there,
  they wouldn't know what the fuck a
  Quarter Pounder is.

  What'd they call it?

  Royale with Cheese.

  Royale with Cheese. What'd they call
  a Big Mac?

  Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
  it Le Big Mac.
